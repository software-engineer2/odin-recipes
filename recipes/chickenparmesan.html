        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Chicken Parmesan is a breaded, fried, and oven-baked chicken recipe. You can pair it with pasta and bread if you want.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
            <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>1 cup panko bread crumbs, or more as needed</li>
            <li>&frac34; cup grated Parmesan cheese, divided</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour, or more if needed</li>
            <li>&frac12; cup olive oil for frying, or as needed</li>
            <li>&frac12; cup prepared tomato sauce</li>
            <li>&frac14; cup fresh mozzarella, cut into small cubes</li>
            <li>&frac14; cup chopped fresh basil</li>
            <li>&frac12; cup grated provolone cheese</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons olive oil</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat an oven to 450 degrees F.</li>
            <li>Place chicken breasts between two sheets of heavy plastic (resealable freezer bags work well) on a solid, level surface. Firmly pound chicken with the smooth side of a meat mallet to a thickness of &frac12;-inch.</li>
            <li>Season chicken thoroughly with salt and pepper. Using a sifter or strainer; sprinkle flour over chicken breasts, evenly coating both sides</li>
            <li>Beat eggs in a shallow bowl and set aside.</li>
            <li>Mix bread crumbs and &frac12; cup Parmesan cheese in a separate bowl, set aside.</li>
            <li>Dip a flour-coated chicken breast in beaten eggs. Transfer breast to the bread crumb mixture, pressing crumbs into both sides. Repeat for each breast. Let chicken rest for 10 to 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Heat &frac12; inch olive oil in a large skillet on medium-high heat until it begins to shimmer. Cook chicken in the hot oil until golden, about 2 minutes per side. The chicken will finish cooking in the oven.</li>
            <li>Transfer chicken to a baking dish. Top each breast with 2 tablespoons tomato sauce. Layer each chicken breast with equal amounts of mozzarella cheese, fresh basil, and provolone cheese. Sprinkle remaining Parmesan over top and drizzle each with &frac12; teaspoon olive oil.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is browned and bubbly and chicken breasts are no longer pink in the center, 15 to 20 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F.</li>
        </ol>
